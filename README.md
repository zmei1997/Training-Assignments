#### Where vs. Having [document](https://github.com/zmei1997/Training-Assignments/blob/main/Day2/WHERE_vs_HAVING.docx)
Difference between WHERE and HAVING:
1.	When the query has a GROUP BY clause, WHERE can only be used before GROUP BY, while HAVING can only be used after GROUP BY.
2.	We cannot use HAVING without GROUP BY. However, we can use WHERE without GROUP BY.
